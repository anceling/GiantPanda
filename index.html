            The GIANT panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca; Chinese: 大熊猫; pinyin: dàxióngmāo), also known as the panda bear or
            simply the panda, is a bear native to south central <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China">China</a>. It is characterised by large, black patches
            around its eyes, over the ears, and across its round body.

        <p>
            The name "giant panda" is sometimes used to distinguish it from the red panda, a neighboring musteloid.
        </p>
        

        <p>
            Though it belongs to the order Carnivora, the giant panda is a folivore, with bamboo shoots and leaves
            making up more than 99% of its diet. Giant pandas in the wild will occasionally eat other grasses, wild
            tubers, or even meat in the form of birds, rodents, or carrion.
        </p>
        <p>
            In captivity, they may receive honey, eggs, fish, yams, shrub leaves, oranges, or bananas along with
            specially prepared food.

        <h3>In zoos</h3>        

<p>
    Pandas have been kept in zoos as early as the Western Han Dynasty in China, where the writer Sima Xiangru noted that the panda was the most treasured animal in the emperor's garden of exotic animals in the capital Chang'an (present Xi'an). Not until the 1950s were pandas again recorded to have been exhibited in China's zoos.

        <h2>Diet</h2>
        <p>Despite its taxonomic classification as a carnivoran, the giant panda's diet is primarily herbivorous,
            consisting almost exclusively of bamboo. However, the giant panda still has the digestive system of a
            carnivore, as well as carnivore-specific genes, and thus derives little energy and little protein from
            consumption of bamboo. Its ability to digest cellulose is ascribed to the microbes in its gut. Pandas are
            born with sterile intestines and require bacteria obtained from their mother's feces to digest vegetation.
            The giant panda is a highly specialised animal with unique adaptations, and has lived in bamboo forests for
            millions of years
